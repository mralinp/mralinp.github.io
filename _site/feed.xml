Intro</h1>

<p>There’s nothing subtle about Mark Manson. He’s crude, vulgar and doesn’t give a f*ck.
But like anything of true value in life, dig a little deeper and you’ll find treasure worthy of any explorer willing to look below the surface.</p>

<p>I recently interviewed Mark about his new book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life, and found that the man behind the profanity is actually incredibly inspiring, deeply philosophical, and extremely clever.</p>

<p>So clever in fact that he’s brilliantly disguised his book using language as a way of tricking the reader into reading a book about values.</p>

<p>At its core, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a book about finding what’s truly important to you and letting go of everything else. In the same way that he encourages limiting exposure to mindless distractions such as social media, television and technology, he encourages limiting concern over things that have little to no meaning or value in your life.</p>

<p>In our interview, Mark said, “If seeing things online or hearing things your co-workers say is really affecting you that much then you need to look at the values in your life. If your emotions are constantly being pushed this way or that way, and you feel like you’re never in control, it’s probably because you’re valuing a lot of the wrong things.”</p>

<p>More than a practical guidebook to choosing what’s important in our lives and what’s unimportant, it’s a brutally honest and much needed reality check about our personal problems, fears and expectations. It’s a bold confrontation of self, our painful truths, faults and uncertainties, without all the positive airy fairy fluff we’ve been spoon-fed to believe by self-help gurus.</p>

<h1 id="2-think-positive">2. Think positive?</h1>

<p>“Fuck positivity,” Manson says. “Let’s be honest; sometimes things are fucked up and we have to live with it.”</p>

<p>Be extraordinary?</p>

<p>“Not everyone can be extraordinary - there are winners and losers in society, and some if it is not fair or your fault,” Manson writes.</p>

<p>Seek happiness?</p>

<p>“The path to happiness is a path full of shit heaps and shame,” he remarks.</p>

<p>By far, my favorite quote in the book. And I’m an incessant happiness seeker.</p>

<p>Reading Mark’s book, I laughed until I snorted and cried until I shriveled. He’s as painfully honest as he is outrageously funny. I find his honesty to be refreshing and fulfilling. When every other self-help book injects you with cheap, feel-good highs that last as long as your nose remains buried in the book and serves no practical purpose out in the mud and grime of your daily life, Mark’s book yanks you out of delusion and denial, points at the pit you’re stuck in and forces you to not only look at the filth and dirt covering you but also to accept it.</p>

<p>This, he says, is the real source of empowerment. “Once we embrace our fears, faults and uncertainties - once we stop running from and avoiding, and start confronting painful truths - we can begin to find the courage and confidence we desperately seek.”</p>

<p>Instead of aiming for an unattainably perfect, problem free, feel-good life, Mark suggests asking the essential question, “What problem do you want to have?”</p>

<p>If it’s true what he writes, that “Life is essentially an endless series of problems. The solution to one problem is merely the creation of another,” then it makes sense when he tells me that life sucks for those who constantly try to get away from problems. Instead of asking “how can I get rid of my problems?” the question becomes, “What are the problems that excite me? What are the problems for which I am willing to sacrifice for, to work for?”</p>

<p>“Predicated on peddling highs to people rather than solving legitimate problems,” he calls the modern self-help market the “french fries and soda version of personal growth”. “It’s really good and easy to consume… but there is an inherently painful and difficult struggle as part of growth and if you are never willing to hit people on the face with that, most people are just gonna avoid it… They’re just going to keep finding more feel-good stuff to distract themselves with.”</p>

<p>As any fast food restaurant can tell you, there’s a lot of money to be made in french fries and soda. And with the self-improvement industry netting $11 billion a year in the US alone, it’s no wonder the market is saturated with touchy feely everything-is-awesome french fries. You can practically lick the hope off your fingers along with the salt.</p>

<p>Manson, on the other hand, offers no hope in his book. At least, not on the surface. “This book doesn’t give a fuck about alleviating your problems or your pain,” he writes. “This book is not some guide to greatness - it couldn’t be, because greatness is merely an illusion in our minds, a made-up destination that we obligate ourselves to pursue, our own psychological Atlantis.”</p>

<p>The irony is the book actually is about greatness. It is hopeful. There’s greatness to be discovered in accepting our lack of greatness, our simplicity and beauty amidst the complex and ugly. And in embracing our problems along with the dirt, muck and grime that essentially accompany life and humanity, we come to live the good life we always yearned for.</p>

<p>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life is a deeply inspiring book about values and purpose cleverly disguised in crude four-letter vulgarity, negativity and apocalyptic doom.</p>

<p>There are no soft puffy cloud prancing unicorns offering hugs on colorful rainbows, only F-bomb explosions and brutal smack-you-in-the-face reality slaps.</p>

<p>But by the time you finish reading it, you’ll find yourself tingling with promise. The world suddenly seems brighter and lighter. You’ll feel free, and oddly, good, despite the shit sandwiches served throughout the book. And it won’t be the surfacey french fry kind of good that makes your body crave real nourishment, but the kind of home-cooked-goodness good that warms you from deep within, like you’ve just been served a hearty platter of whole, raw, organic, unfiltered truth.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ali N.

Intro</h1>

<p>PyTorch is a fully featured framework for building deep learning models, which is a type of machine learning that’s commonly used in applications like image recognition and language processing. Written in Python, it’s relatively easy for most machine learning developers to learn and use. PyTorch is distinctive for its excellent support for GPUs and its use of reverse-mode auto-differentiation, which enables computation graphs to be modified on the fly. This makes it a popular choice for fast experimentation and prototyping.</p>

<p>PyTorch is a machine learning framework based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella. It is free and open-source software released under the modified BSD license.</p>

<p>PyTorch is the work of developers at Facebook AI Research and several other labs. The framework combines the efficient and flexible GPU-accelerated backend libraries from Torch with an intuitive Python frontend that focuses on rapid prototyping, readable code, and support for the widest possible variety of deep learning models. Pytorch lets developers use the familiar imperative programming approach, but still output to graphs.  It was released to open source in 2017, and its Python roots have made it a favorite with machine learning developers.</p>

<p>Significantly, PyTorch adopted a Chainer innovation called reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Essentially, it’s like a tape recorder that records completed operations and then replays backward to compute gradients. This makes PyTorch relatively simple to debug and well-adapted to certain applications such as dynamic neural networks. It’s popular for prototyping because every iteration can be different.</p>

<p>PyTorch is especially popular with Python developers because it’s written in Python and uses that language’s imperative, define-by-run eager execution mode in which operations are executed as they are called from Python. As the popularity of the Python programming language persists, a survey identified a growing focus on AI and machine learning tasks and, with them, greater adoption of related PyTorch. This makes PyTorch a good choice for Python developers who are new to deep learning, and a growing library of deep learning courses are based on PyTorch. The API has remained consistent from early releases, meaning that the code is relatively easy for experienced Python developers to understand.</p>

<p>PyTorch’s particular strength is in rapid prototyping and smaller projects. Its ease of use and flexibility also makes it a favorite for academic and research communities.</p>

<p>Facebook developers have been working hard to improve PyTorch’s productive applications. Recent releases have provided enhancements like support for Google’s TensorBoard visualization tool, and just-in-time compilation. It has also expanded support for ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange), which enables developers to match with deep learning frameworks or runtimes that work best for their applications.</p>

<h1 id="2-installing-pytorch">2. Installing PyTorch</h1>

<p>You can folow this tutorial using some online platforms such as <a href="https://colab.research.google.com">Google Colab</a> or <a href="https://kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> which give you a python environment via a jupyter note book and a proper GPU to meet your needs during learning process and even doing small projects and homeworks. If you prefer using these platforms you can skip this section but if you want to use pythorch on your local machine and use your own GPU here is the installation steps that you should folow.</p>

<h2 id="21-installing-pytorch">2.1 Installing PyTorch</h2>

<p>You can folow the steps on PyTorch official website <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">pytorch.org</a> to install it locally or stay with me.</p>

<p>If you haven’t installed Anaconda on your machine download and install anaconda then create a conda environment:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>conda create <span class="nt">--name</span> torch <span class="nv">python</span><span class="o">=</span>3.9
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After creating the environment activate it using:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>conda activate torch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then use pip to install PyTorch:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>pip <span class="nb">install </span>torch torchvision torchaudio
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It will take some time but will install pytorch and all gpu requirements on your machine.</p>

<p>to test that if gpu is supported, open a python file and run the code below:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">torch</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s">"Is GPU supported? </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="s">'Yes'</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">torch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">cuda</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">is_avaiable</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="s">'No'</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<pre><code class="language-output">Is GPU supported? Yes
</code></pre>

<p>Well done, you have installed PyTorch on your computer and ready to go through this tutorial.</p>

<h1 id="3-tensor-basics">3. Tensor basics</h1>
<p>The very basic class in PyTorch library is the tensor class. almost Every variable and operation in PyTorch is represented by a tensor. You can look at the tensor as just like a numpy array or a multi-dimensional python list.
Because of the mathematical nature of Machine Learning operations which are performed on lineralgebra, we need such a class to implement and use the calculations in python.</p>

<p>Tensor can be used in CPU or GPU. Using GPU makes the calculations so much fater. To move the tensor to GPU, you have to use  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tensor.to('cuda')</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tensor.to(device)</code> function.</p>

<h2 id="31-operations-and-gradian-calculation">3.1 Operations and gradian calculation</h2>
<p>In PyTorch every calculation is represented by a cumputation graph. For example, if we say \(y = x + 2\) this will build a graph as below:</p>

<p>This is due to the ace of the gradient calculation. The gradients are required for optimization of the model weights. This computation graphs used in coputing the gradients based on the chain rule and Jacobian matrix method. The gradient calculation can be automatically done using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">backward</code> function.

<h1 id="4-linear-regression">4. Linear regression</h1>
<p>Learning by doing a real project is a perfect way to gain some kinds of skills specially programming. To undrestand the basics of using the framework, it’s recommended to implement a simple mini project step by step from scratch. We choose linear regression as the training example and will gothrough the implementations from scrach and with out using pythorch. Then we will convert the code into using PyTorch and advanced functions.</p>

<h2 id="41-problem-statement">4.1 Problem statement</h2>

<p>Simple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two quantitative variables. You can use simple linear regression when you want to know:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How strong the relationship is between two variables (e.g., the relationship between rainfall and soil erosion).</li>
  <li>The value of the dependent variable at a certain value of the independent variable (e.g., the amount of soil erosion at a certain level of rainfall).</li>
</ol>

<p>Regression models describe the relationship between variables by fitting a line to the observed data. Linear regression models use a straight line, while logistic and nonlinear regression models use a curved line. Regression allows you to estimate how a dependent variable changes as the independent variable(s) change.</p>

<p>The formula for a simple linear regression is:</p>

\[y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} . X + \epsilon\]

<ul>
  <li><strong>\(y\)</strong> is the predicted value of the dependent variable (\(y\)) for any given value of the independent variable (\(x\)).</li>
  <li><strong>\(\beta_0\)</strong> is the intercept, the predicted value of \(y\) when the \(x\) is \(0\).</li>
  <li><strong>\(\beta_1\)</strong> is the regression coefficient – how much we expect \(y\) to change as \(x\) increases.</li>
  <li><strong>\(x\)</strong> is the independent variable ( the variable we expect is influencing \(y\)).</li>
  <li><strong>\(\epsilon\)</strong> is the error of the estimate, or how much variation there is in our estimate of the regression coefficient.</li>
</ul>

<p>Linear regression finds the line of best fit line through your data by searching for the regression coefficient (B1) that minimizes the total error (e) of the model.</p>

<p>The loss function or error function in linear regression is determined by <strong>M</strong>ean <strong>S</strong>quared <strong>E</strong>rror or MSE.</p>

\[L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\hat{Y}_{i} - Y_{i})^2\]

<p>To minimize the error, we have to update the regression coefficients by computing the gradient with respect to the dependent variables (Model weights). And update the regression coefficients as below:</p>

\[w = w - \alpha.\frac{dJ}{dw}\]

<p>Which:</p>

\[\frac{dJ}{dw} = \frac{1}{N} . 2x . (\hat{y}-y)\]

<p>For this example we define a simple training set which is a set of 2D points \((x,y)\) such that \(y = 2 \times x\).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>x</th>
      <th>y</th>

<p>In PyTorch the forward pass in callcuating the layer output is done by calling the forward function which, represents the forward pass of the network. In conclution, we will call the model output function, the forward function.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Forward pass:
# Predict the output of the network on the input data.
</span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">forward</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">weights</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">weights</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then we have to define the loss function of the network which is the MSE loss function:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Model loss function:
# MSE = 1/N * sum((y_i - y_hat_i)^2)
</span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y_pred</span><span class="p">):</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Finally, we will need a function to calculate the gradient of the network coefficients, which in pytorch is called the backward function.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Calculating gradiants:

<p>As you can see, the model converged after 100 iterations and successfully predicted the expected value for \(x=6\) which is \(y=12\).</p>

<h2 id="42-including-pytorch">4.2 Including PyTorch</h2>

<p>We implemented a simple linear regression model from scratch and only using numpy. Now it’s time to include PyTorch in our code. First, we have to turn every variable (\(x\), \(y\) and \(w\)) into a tensor instead of numpy arrays.</p>

<p>In the above code, while defining the weight parameter, we said that it requires tracking the gradiant calculation for this tensor by setting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">require_grad</code> parameter to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code>. If we don’t set this parameter to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code>, while calling the backward function, it will throw an exception because it doesn not stored the gradients in the computation graph. So, be careful when defining a tensor which is requred to calculate the gradients.</p>

<p>Next, we have to define the forward and loss function for the model.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Forward pass:
# Predict the output of the network on the input data.
</span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">forward</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">weights</span><span class="p">):</span>

<span class="c1"># Model loss function:

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we said in the previous section, gradients can be calculated by calling the backward function. For this reason, there is no need to define the backward function. While calling the backward function, the calculated gradients will remain in the computation graph until you free its memory. and this could be done by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tensor.grad.zero_()</code> function. So, be carefull while calling the backward function and make sure that you free the memory associated with the gradients (you can see this in the code below).</p>

<h2 id="43-more-including-pytorch">4.3 More including PyTorch</h2>
<p>Now, let’s use the built-in PyTorch optimizer and loss function as well as the built-in forward function. First change that we should make is to remove the loss function that we where using and use the built-in MSELoss instead. Then, instead of manually updating the model parameters, we can use the built-in optimizers such as <strong>S</strong>tochastic <strong>G</strong>radient <strong>D</strong>escent (SGD), Adam or etc.</p>

<p>As we know, this model is a single linear nuron which can be represented by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.nn.linear(input_size, output_size)</code>. This layer has its own parameters which means it’s not required to define the weights parameter \(w\) any more.</p>

<p>While using optimizers, calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optimizer.step()</code> will automatically update the model parameters and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optimizer.zero_grad()</code> will automatically free the gradients memory.</p>

<h2 id="44-turning-model-into-a-torch-module">4.4 Turning model into a Torch module</h2>

<p>We can define blocks of layers as modules in PyTorch which are called <strong>modules</strong>. To do so, we have to define a class which inherits from the base <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.nn.Module</code> class and implement the forward function for that module.</p>

<p>As you can see, in the code, when we want to compute the accuracy of the model, we dont need to to keep track of calculated gradients of the calculation. To prevent this to affect our training and calculations, we have to turn this tracking off. This can be done by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.no_grad()</code> in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> block or making a detached copy of the variables directly by calling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tensor.detach()</code> function of that tensor and then atthatch it agin.</p>

Intro</h1>
<p>Big Data powered machine learning and deep learning has yielded impressive advances in many fields. One example is the release of ImageNet consisting of more than 15 million labelled high-resolution images of 22,000 categories which revolutionized the field of computer vision. State-of-the-art models have already achieved a 98% top-five accuracy on the ImageNet dataset, so it seems as though these models are foolproof and that nothing can go wrong.</p>

<p>However, recent advances in adversarial training have found that this is an illusion. A good model misbehaves frequently when faced with adversarial examples. The image below illustrates the problem:</p>
<p align="center">
 <img src="/assets/images/adversarial-attack/1.png" />
</p>
<p>The model initially classifies the panda picture correctly, but when some noise, imperceptible to human beings, is injected into the picture, the resulting prediction of the model is changed to another animal, gibbon, even with such a high confidence. To us, it appears as if the initial and altered images are the same, although it is radically different to the model. This illustrates the threat these adversarial attacks pose — we may not perceive the difference so we cannot tell an adversarial attack as happened. Hence, although the output of the model may be altered, we cannot tell if the output is correct or incorrect.</p>

<p>This formed the motivation behind the talk for Professor Ling Liu’s keynote speech at the 2019 IEEE Big Data Conference, where she touched on types of adversarial attacks, how adversarial examples are generated, and how to combat against these attacks. Without further ado, I will get into the contents of her speech.</p>

<h1 id="2-types-of-adversarial-attacks">2. Types of adversarial attacks</h1>

<p>Adversarial attacks are classified into two categories — targeted attacks and untargeted attacks.</p>

<p>The targeted attack has a target class, Y, that it wants the target model, M, to classify the image I of class X as. Hence, the goal of the targeted attack is to make M misclassify by predicting the adversarial example, I, as the intended target class Y instead of the true class X. On the other hand, the untargeted attack does not have a target class which it wants the model to classify the image as. Instead, the goal is simply to make the target model misclassify by predicting the adversarial example, I, as a class, other than the original class, X.
Researchers have found that in general, although untargeted attacks are not as good as targeted attacks, they take much less time. Targeted attacks, although more successful in altering the predictions of the model, come at a cost (time).</p>

<h1 id="3-how-are-adversarial-examples-generated">3. How are Adversarial Examples Generated</h1>

<p>Having understood the difference between targeted and untargeted attacks, we now come to the question of how these adversarial attacks are carried out. In a benign machine learning system, the training process seeks to minimize the loss between the target label and the predicted label, formulated mathematically as such:</p>

<!-- Image -->

<p>During the testing phase, the learned model is tested to determine how well it can predict the predicted label. Error is then calculated by the sum of the loss between the target label and the predicted label, formulated mathematically as such:
<!-- Image -->
In adversarial attacks, the following 2 steps are taken:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The query input is changed from the benign input x to \(x^\prime\).</li>
  <li>An attack goal is set such that the prediction outcome, \(H(x)\) is no longer \(y\). The loss is changed from \(L(H(x_i), y_i)\) to \(L(H(x_i), y^{\prime}_i)\) where \(y^{\prime}_i  \ne y_i\).</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="4-adversarial-perturbation">4. Adversarial Perturbation</h1>
<p>One way the query input is changed from x to x’ is through the method called “adversarial perturbation”, where the perturbation is computed such that the prediction will not be the same as the original label. For images, this can come in the form of pixel noise as we saw above with the panda example. Untargeted attacks have the single goal of maximizing the loss between H(x) and H(x’) until the prediction outcome is not y (the real label). Targeted attacks have an additional goal of not only maximizing the loss between H(x) and H(x’) but also to minimize the loss between H(x’) and y’ until H(x’) = y’ instead of y.</p>

<p>Adversarial perturbation can then be categorized into one-step and multi-step perturbation. As the names imply, the one-step perturbation only involves a single stage — add noise once and that is it. On the other hand, the multi-step perturbation is an iterative attack that makes small modifications to the input each time. Therefore, the one-step attack is fast but excessive noise may be added, hence making it easier for humans to detect the changes. Furthermore, it places more weight on the objective of maximizing loss between H(x) and H(x’) and less on minimizing the amount of perturbation. Conversely, the multi-step attack is more strategic as it introduces small amounts of perturbation at each time. However, this also means such an attack is computationally more expensive.</p>

<h1 id="5-black-box-vs-white-box-attacks">5. Black Box VS White Box Attacks</h1>
<p>Now that we have looked at how adversarial attacks are generated, some astute readers may realize one fundamental assumption these attacks take on — that the attack target prediction model, H, is known to the adversary. Only when the targeted model is known can it be compromised to generate adversarial examples by changing the input. However, attackers do not always know or have access to the targeted model. This may sound like a surefire way to ward off these adversarial attackers, but the truth is that black box attacks are also highly effective.
Black box attacks are based on the notion of transferability of adversarial examples — the phenomenon whereby adversarial examples, although generated to attack a surrogate model G, can achieve impressive results when attacking another model H. The steps taken are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The attack target prediction model H is privately trained and unknown to the adversary.</li>
  <li>A surrogate model G, which mimics H, is used to generate adversarial examples.</li>
  <li>By using the transferability of adversarial examples, black box attacks can be launched to attack H.</li>
</ol>

<p>This attack can be launched either with the training dataset being known or unknown. In the case where the dataset is known to the adversary, the model G can be trained on the same dataset as model H to mimic H.</p>

<p>When the training dataset is unknown however, adversaries can leverage on Membership Inference Attacks, whereby an attack model whose purpose is to distinguish the target model’s behavior on the training inputs from its behavior on the inputs that it did not encounter during training is trained. In essence, this turns into a classification problem to recognize differences in the target model’s predictions on the inputs that it trained on versus the inputs that it did not train on. This enables the adversary to obtain a better sense of the training dataset D which model H was trained on, enabling the attacker to generate a shadow dataset S on the basis of the true training dataset so as to train the surrogate model G. Having trained G on S where G mimics H and S mimics D, black box attacks can then be launched on H.</p>

<h2 id="51-black-box-attacks">5.1 Black Box Attacks</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen how black box attacks vary from white box attacks in that the target model H is unknown to the adversary, we will cover the various tactics used in black box attacks.</p>

<h2 id="52-white-box-attacks">5.2 White Box Attacks</h2>

<h2 id="53-physical-attacks">5.3 Physical Attacks</h2>
<p>One simple way in which the query input is changed from x to x’ is by simply adding something physically (eg. bright colour) to disturb the model. One example is how researchers at CMU added eyeglasses to a person in an attack against facial recognition models. The image below illustrates the attack:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/adversarial-attack/2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The first row of images correspond to the original image modified by adding the eyeglasses, and the second row of images correspond to the impersonation targets, which are the intended misclassification targets. Just by adding the eyeglasses onto the original image, the facial recognition model was tricked into classifying the images on the top row as the images in the bottom row.</p>

<p>Another example comes from researchers at Google who added stickers to the input image to change the classification of the image, as illustrated by the image below:
<img src="/assets/images/adversarial-attack/3.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>These examples show how effective such physical attacks can be.</p>

<h2 id="54-out-of-distribution-ood-attack">5.4 Out of Distribution (OOD) Attack</h2>
<p>Another way in which black box attacks are carried out is through out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks. The traditional assumption in machine learning is that all train and test examples are drawn independently from the same distribution. In an OOD attack, this assumption is exploited by providing images of a different distribution from the training dataset to the model, for example feeding TinyImageNet data into a CIFAR-10 classifier which would lead to an incorrect prediction with high confidence.</p>

<h1 id="6-how-can-we-trust-machine-learning">6. How Can We Trust Machine Learning?</h1>
<p>Now that we have taken a look at the various types of adversarial attacks, a natural question then comes — how can we trust our machine learning models if they are so susceptible to adversarial attacks?</p>

<p>One possible approach has been proposed by Chow et al. in 2019 in the paper titled “Denoising and Verification Cross-Layer Ensemble Against Black-box Adversarial Attacks”. The approach is centred around enabling machine learning systems to automatically detect adversarial attacks and then automatically repair them through the use of denoising and verification ensembles.</p>

<h1 id="7-denoising-ensembles">7. Denoising Ensembles</h1>
<p>First, input images have to pass through denoising ensembles that attempt different methods to remove any added noise to the image, for example adding Gaussian noise. Since the specific noise added to the image by the adversary is unknown to the defender, there is a need for an ensemble of denoisers to each attempt to remove each type of noise.</p>

<p>The image below shows the training process for the denoising autoencoder — the original image is injected with some noise that the attacker might inject, and the autoencoder tries to reconstruct the original uncorrupted image. In the training process, the objective is to reduce the reconstruction error between the reconstructed image and the original image.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/adversarial-attack/4.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>By developing an ensemble of these autoencoders each trained to remove a specific type of noise, the hope is that the corrupted images would be sufficiently denoised such that it is close to the original uncorrupted image to allow for image classification.</p>

<h2 id="71-verification-ensemble">7.1 Verification Ensemble</h2>
<p>After the images have been denoised, they then go through a verification ensemble which reviews every denoised image produced by each denoiser and then classifies the denoised image. Each classifier in the verification ensemble classifies each denoised image, and the ensemble then votes to determine the final category the image belongs to. This means that although some images may not have been denoised the correct way in the denoising step, the verification ensemble votes on all the denoised images, thereby increasing the likelihood of making a more accurate prediction.</p>

<h2 id="72-diversity">7.2 Diversity</h2>
<p>Diversity of the denoisers and verifiers have found to be very important because firstly, adversarial attackers will get better at altering images so there is a need for a diverse group of denoisers that can handle a variety of corrupted images. Following this, there is also a need for verifiers to be diverse so they can generate a variety of classifications so that it would be difficult adversarial attackers to manipulate them just as how they have managed to manipulate normal classifiers that we trust and use so frequently in machine learning.</p>

<p>This remains an open problem because, after all these decisions by the various verifiers, there is still a final decision maker that needs to decide whose opinion to listen to. The final decision maker would need to preserve the diversity present in the ensemble, which is not an easy task to tackle.</p>

<h1 id="8-conclusion">8. Conclusion</h1>
<p>We have taken a look at various types of adversarial attacks as well as a promising method to defend against these attacks. This is definitely something to keep in mind when we implement machine learning models. Instead of blindly trusting the models to produce the correct results, we need to guard against these adversarial attacks and always think twice before we accept the decisions made by these models.</p>

<p>A huge thanks to Professor Liu for this enlightening keynote on this pressing problem in machine learning!</p>

Intro</h1>

<p>The rise to prominence of deep learning over the past decade is spectacular. From dominating in almost every single competition with its innovative and groundbreaking technologies, it has also led to several new types of research and training methods. One of the most popular ways to handle deep learning models to solve complex computational problems is with the help of deep frameworks.</p>

<p>One such popular deep learning library to build and construct models to find solutions to numerous tasks is TensorFlow. TensorFlow is regarded as one of the best libraries to solve almost any question related to neural networks and deep learning. While this library performs effectively with most smaller and simpler datasets to achieve tasks on a CPU, its true power lies in the utilization of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).</p>

<p>The GPU improvises the performance of this deep learning framework to reach new heights and peaks. However, one of the most annoying issues that deep learning programmers, developers, and enthusiasts face is the trouble of CUDA errors. This experience is rather frustrating for most individuals because it is a common occurrence while dealing with deep learning models.</p>

<p>In this article, we will explore how to get the latest version of TensorFlow and stay updated with modern technology.</p>

<p>We will use Anacoda because it’s almost the best python environment for machine-learning operations. To get started, let’s install anacoda on your computer. You can skip this step if you already have installed Anacoda on your Ubuntu machine.</p>

<p>Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is developed and maintained by Anaconda, Inc., which was founded by Peter Wang and Travis Oliphant in 2012. As an Anaconda, Inc. product, it is also known as Anaconda Distribution or Anaconda Individual Edition, while other products from the company are Anaconda Team Edition and Anaconda Enterprise Edition, both of which are not free. For me and probably you and almost 90% of people, the free version is good and does the job well for us. Installing anaconda requires installing For Debian based distros (such as Ubuntu) run the command below:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>libgl1-mesa-glx libegl1-mesa libxrandr2 libxrandr2 libxss1 libxcursor1 libxcomposite1 libasound2 libxi6 libxtst6
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>For installing Anaconda you can visit its official website <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution">anaconda.com</a> and download the latest installer version or Run the command below:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>curl https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh | /bin/bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then follow the installation process to complete it. Close and re-open your terminal window for the installation to take effect, or enter the command source ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc if you are using zsh) to refresh the terminal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: The installer prompts you to choose whether to initialize Anaconda Distribution by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conda init</code>. Anaconda recommends entering “yes”. If you enter “no”, then conda will not modify your shell scripts at all. To initialize after the installation process is done, first run source [PATH TO CONDA]/bin/activate and then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conda init</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="21-creating-conda-environment">2.1 Creating Conda Environment</h2>

<p>Create a new conda environment named tf with the following command.</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>conda create <span class="nt">--name</span> tf <span class="nv">python</span><span class="o">=</span>3.9

Intro</h1>
<p>Last time, I wrote an article about bypassing God’s government restrictions to be able to access the outside world. Now the base solution still stands, but the protocol we used to implement that solution no longer works. We can clap our hands to the government priests for upgrading their knowledge about VPN protocols and say bravo in chinese “<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%E9%AB%98%E4%B8%9D%E7%BA%B3%E7%BA%B3%E9%A1%BF&amp;op=translate" title="Kose na na ton!">高丝纳纳顿</a>”.</p>

<p>As our government and Chinese folks are each other’s besties and in the same bed! we can conclude that any protocol that works on the great firewall of china, should work for the evils firewall of the Islamic Republic!</p>

<p>V2Ray is a VPN protocol written with love by some free Chinese people. It works on the application layer and its traffic looks like working with an actual web-site and it’s less prone to detect. The problem with V2Ray is the english language support, documentations and weak client software which can easily be improved if their community decided to share their information and issues in english not in fucking chinees!</p>

<p>For this article we consider you have access to a Virtual Machine in the outside world. You can access that machine using SSH or you can easily install a cockpit to be able to access your Linux machine through the browser.</p>

<h2 id="11-installing-cockpit-optional">1.1 Installing Cockpit (Optional)</h2>
<p>To install Cockpit, connect to your machine using ssh and use the aptitude package manager to install cockpit:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt update <span class="nt">--yes</span>
<span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt upgrade <span class="nt">--yes</span>
<span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>cockpit <span class="nt">--yes</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This should install the cockpit and dose all the configurations for you. The cockpit is a web-based control panel and it will run on port 9090 of the server so, you have to allow connecting this port if your firewall is enabled:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>ufw allow 9090
<span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>ufw disable
<span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>ufw <span class="nb">enable</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then open a browser and type the address <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YOUR_VM_IP:9090</code> to see the cockpit panel.
Username and password of cockpit panel are the same as your vm user for example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">username: root
password: 123456
</code></pre>

<p align="center">
    <img width="80%" src="/assets/images/projects/v2ray/cockpit.png" />
</p>

<h1 id="2-installing-v2ray-using-x-ui">2. Installing V2ray using X-UI</h1>
<p>To install V2ray you can easily install X-UI panel on your machine and this will automatically install all necessary things for you. X-UI documentation could be found here: <a href="https://seakfind.github.io/2021/10/10/X-UI/"><strong>seakfind</strong></a></p>

<p>The installation process is pretty easy, just connect to your machine and install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">socat</code> first:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>curl socat <span class="nt">-y</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you can skip obtaining certificate steps and directly jump on installing the x-ui using its script:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>bash &lt;<span class="o">(</span>curl <span class="nt">-Ls</span> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaxilu/x-ui/master/install.sh<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then it will ask you to type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yes|no</code>, you type yes and press enter on any chinese message prompt it shows to you. That’s it, you can start  the panel by typing:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>x-ui start
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It starts the X-UI panel on the port <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">54321</code> of server. Open a browser and type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YOUR_VM_IP:54321</code> in the address bar to see the panel. Default username and password are:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">username: admin
password: admin
</code></pre>

<p align="center">
    <img width="80%" src="/assets/images/projects/v2ray/xui.png" />
</p>

<p>Default language of x-ui is chaines, i use Google chrome and Google translate to translate its contexts to english and i recommend you to do so.</p>

<p>After login, you have to go and change the default username and password of the panel (You can change the default port as well). From the sidebar panel select the third option, then select the second tab. Now type the old username and password on first two fields the new ones on the next two. Press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Revise</code> to save the changes.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img width="80%" src="/assets/images/projects/v2ray/x-ui-1.png" />
</p>

<p>Now go to inbound list from the sidebar and press add for creating a new VPN configuration. For example you can select VMess or VLess protocol under Websocket(ws) as you can see on the picture below. If you choose VLess be aware of that VLess has no encryption and VMess is a better choice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: You can go and search for other V2Ray configurations but VMess is good enough for our article.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center">
    <img width="80%" src="/assets/images/projects/v2ray/xui-u.png" />
</p>

<p>Now, you are all set, you can scan the QR code or press copy share link to copy the share link to the clip board and send it to your clients.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img width="80%" src="/assets/images/projects/v2ray/x-ui-2.png" />
</p>

<h1 id="3-clients-setup-for-using-v2ray">3. Clients setup for using V2Ray</h1>
<p>To connect to the V2Ray server you have to install the proper client application on your devices. Here is a list of application clients for different devices and operating systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Android</strong>: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.v2ray.ang">V2rayNG (Google play)</a></li>

<h1 id="4-using-tls-optional-but-recommended">4. Using TLS (Optional but, recommended.)</h1>

<p>To make the clients connection more secure and safer, we need to use TLS on our server.</p>
<h2 id="41-what-is-transport-layer-security-tls">4.1 What is Transport Layer Security (TLS)?</h2>

<p>Transport Layer Security, or TLS, is a widely adopted security protocol designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. A primary use case of TLS is encrypting the communication between web applications and servers, such as web browsers loading a website. TLS can also be used to encrypt other communications such as email, messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). In this article we will focus on the role of TLS in web application security.</p>

<p>TLS was proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an international standards organization, and the first version of the protocol was published in 1999. The most recent version is TLS 1.3, which was published in 2018.</p>

<p>In machine learning, a Variational AutoEncoder, is an artificial neural network architecture introduced by Diederik P. Kingma and Max Welling, belonging to the families of probabilistic graphical models and variational Bayesian methods. Variational autoencoders are often associated with the autoencoder model because of its architectural affinity, but with significant differences in the goal and mathematical formulation. Variational autoencoders allow statistical inference problems to be rewritten as statistical optimization problems. They are meant to map the input variable to a multivariate latent distribution. Although this type of model was initially designed for unsupervised learning, its effectiveness has been proven for semi-supervised learning and supervised learning (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

Although this type of model was initially designed for unsupervised learning, its effectiveness has been proven for semi-supervised learning and supervised learning (Wikipedia).]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Getting started with game hacking: Making a CS:GO cheat</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/project/security/cracking/game-hacking/2022/10/09/csgo-cheat.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting started with game hacking: Making a CS:GO cheat" /><published>2022-10-09T12:21:13+03:30</published><updated>2022-10-09T12:21:13+03:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/project/security/cracking/game-hacking/2022/10/09/csgo-cheat</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/project/security/cracking/game-hacking/2022/10/09/csgo-cheat.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>This project is an example of game hacking, and it’s created to share the personal experience with other enthusiasts in this branch of software security.
This project is just for educational proposes and i’m not responsible for any other subversive applications.
As you know game hacking in online games is not allowed owing to annoying some other people. Normal players who just want to have fun with games, don’t want to face a demon hacker in their fun times, so game developers will respond if you do something to annoy other players. In other words cheating in online games will cause your account be banned (e.g VACation on steam platform).</p>]]></content><author><name>Ali N.
