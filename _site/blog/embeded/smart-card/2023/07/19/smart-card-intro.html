  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Multiple Applications</strong>:
Smart cards have the ability to support multiple applications simultaneously. For example, a single smart card can be used for electronic payments, access control, and healthcare records. The operating system facilitates seamless execution and switching between these applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dynamic Updates</strong>:
The operating system can be updated or patched to address security vulnerabilities or add new features to the smart card without replacing the physical card itself.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Due to these advanced features, smart cards have become a reliable and secure tool for various applications, such as financial transactions, secure access control, healthcare, and more. The combination of a microprocessor and an operating system empowers smart cards to deliver enhanced functionality, robust security, and unparalleled convenience in the digital age.</p>

<p>In the context of smart cards, an applet refers to a small, specialized software application that runs on the smart card’s microprocessor and is managed by the card’s operating system. These applets are designed to perform specific functions or provide particular services on the smart card. They enable the smart card to support various applications and perform tasks relevant to the cardholder’s needs.</p>

<h1 id="1-applets">1. Applets</h1>

<p>Applets on smart cards are comparable to apps on a smartphone. Each applet functions as a self-contained program with a defined set of functionalities, and multiple applets can coexist on the same smart card without interfering with each other. This modularity and isolation of applets are essential for maintaining security and ensuring that sensitive data from one application remains isolated from others.</p>

<p>The key characteristics of applets on smart cards include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Security</strong>:
Applets are designed with security in mind, ensuring that the data and operations they perform remain protected from unauthorized access. The smart card’s operating system enforces strict access controls to prevent unauthorized applets from interfering with sensitive data or executing malicious operations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Isolation</strong>:
Each applet runs within its own secure execution environment, isolated from other applets on the smart card. This isolation prevents one applet from accessing data or resources belonging to another, ensuring a high level of data privacy and integrity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Flexibility</strong>:
Applets can be added, removed, or updated on the smart card without replacing the physical card itself. This flexibility allows card issuers to introduce new services or applications to the card without disrupting existing functionalities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Common Criteria Compliance</strong>:
Applets are typically developed following the Common Criteria standard, which defines security requirements for evaluating and certifying the security of IT products, including smart cards.</p>
  </li>
