<p>Big Data powered machine learning and deep learning has yielded impressive advances in many fields. One example is the release of ImageNet consisting of more than 15 million labelled high-resolution images of 22,000 categories which revolutionized the field of computer vision. State-of-the-art models have already achieved a 98% top-five accuracy on the ImageNet dataset, so it seems as though these models are foolproof and that nothing can go wrong.</p>
