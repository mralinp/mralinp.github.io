<p>Hello there, this is Ali speaking. When i started studying computer engineering at Shiraz university, CSE101 was the very primarly course that we should take to get familiar with the basic concepts of programming. They introduced <strong>python</strong> to us for the first time. Python is a very cool programming language that have very waste practical areas in almost any majors such as Data science, machine learning, web-development, game development, etc.</p>
